			The object of the game is to come up with the most words possible to achieve
			the highest score you can.  Players receive a prompt,"words that start with
			the letter T".  Players then have to come up with words that start with the
			letter T.  Letters begin to drop off as the game goes on so it becomes more
			challenging.  By the end of the 3 minute game there will be 5 letters missing.
			The longer the word the more points players receive.  Good luck!
